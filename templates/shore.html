        <p>You see a small opening in the thick jungle to your right as you walk by. A weird force seems to be pushing you to go into the jungle, and you glance at the crooked path of steps lying there in wait for you.</p>
        <p>Do you decide to test it out and try to figure out what it could be? Or do you carry on and serach for stuff that will actually be crucial to your survial?</p>
