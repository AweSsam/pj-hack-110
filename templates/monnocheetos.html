        <p>You stay very still in front of the monkey, and the monkey snorts.</p>
        <p>You frown. Was the monkey laughing at you?</p>
        <p>The monkey reaches down, and snatches your cheeto packet and runs away. You stand there shellshocked, and dazedly continue your path towards nowhere.</p>
        <p>Due to the lack of food and water, you collapse on your journey a few days later.</p>
